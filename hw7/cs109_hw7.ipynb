    "## Question 5: Including an 'abstain' option\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons a hospital might be hesitant to use your thyroid classification model is that a misdiagnosis by the model on a patient can sometimes prove to be very costly (e.g. if the patient were to file a law suit seeking a compensation for damages). One way to mitigate this concern is to allow the model to 'abstain' from making a prediction, whenever it is uncertain about the diagnosis for a patient. However, when the model abstains from making a prediction, the hospital will have to forward the patient to a thyroid specialist (i.e. an endocrinologist), which would incur additional cost. How does one design a thyroid classification model with an abstain option, such that the cost to the hospital is minimized?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. More specifically, suppose the cost incurred by a hospital when a model mis-predicts on a patient is \\$5000, and the cost incurred when the model abstains from making a prediction is \\$1000. What is the average cost per patient for the OvR logistic regression model from Question 1, Part 3? Note that this needs to be evaluated on the patients in the test set. Your task is to design a classification strategy (into the 3 groups plus the *abstain* group) that has as low cost as possible per patient.   Give a justification for your approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Presentation:** Prepare a set of 5 slides explaining your approach to the hospital management. Your presentation must be accessible to the lay man. Explain in particular how your approach would be robust to changes in the costs of using the abstain option.\n",
