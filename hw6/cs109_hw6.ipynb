    "In this homework, we will consider the problem of early breast cancer detection from X-ray images. Specifically, given a candidate region of interest (ROI) from an X-ray image of a patient's breast, the goal is to predict if the region corresponds to a malignant tumor (label 1) or is normal (label 0). The training and test data sets for this problem is provided in the file `hw6_dataset.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a ROI in a patient's X-ray, with columns 1-117 containing features computed using standard image processing algorithms. The last column contains the class label, and is based on a radiologist's opinion or a biopsy. This data was obtained from the KDD Cup 2008 challenge.\n",

Both exhibit almost near perfect accuracy (1.0), though, this is not surprising given the highly imbalanced nature of the data set (68689 - 0 and 409 - 1 for the original data set), just predict the most common response, in this case, 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while sensitivity and specificity are easy to measure, they're not very useful in clinical practice since a clinician doesn't know if a given patient has the disease in question or not.  This is the reason why the clinician performs the diagnostic test in the first place. Instead, the clinician wants to know, given the test result, how likely is it that the patient has the disease, this is known as the positive predictive value (ppv).\n",

    "A different picture emerges when we compare the confusion matrices, true positive rates, and true negative rates of the two classifiers.  When making comparisons, the fitted logistic regression classifier is clearly the superior model, based on comparing the true positive rates: 27% for the logistic regression classifier vs 0% for the all 0's classifier. Given that we're trying to identify a malignant tumor, a potentially fatal condition, the all 0's classifier will never predict a malignant tumor, making it a totally ineffective model.  \n",

    "The true negative rates for both classifiers are almost equivalent, at or very near to 100%: 99.96% for the fitted logistic regression classifier and 100% for the all 0's classifier.  However, for such a serious condition, we'd rather have a higher true positive rates at the expense of a lower true negative rates.  While there's definitely room for improvement in the logistic regression classifier's true positive rate, anything is better than the all 0's classifier true positive rate of 0%!\n",

    "The fitted classifier ROC curve is much better, its True Positive values are always larger than the coresponding all 0's classifier ROC curve values for any given False Positive value, or, put another way, tends toward the upper left quadrant of the plot.  The all 0's classifier ROC curve is a straight line with slope = 1 with y-intercept at x = 0.  This is equivalent to a truly random (and therefore useless) classifier, meaning, it's no better at identifying true positives than flipping a coin.  Such as classifier will have an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.5, the lowest possible value.\n",
