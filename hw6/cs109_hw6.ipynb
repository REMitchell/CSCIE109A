    "In this homework, we will consider the problem of early breast cancer detection from X-ray images. Specifically, given a candidate region of interest (ROI) from an X-ray image of a patient's breast, the goal is to predict if the region corresponds to a malignant tumor (label 1) or is normal (label 0). The training and test data sets for this problem is provided in the file `hw6_dataset.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a ROI in a patient's X-ray, with columns 1-117 containing features computed using standard image processing algorithms. The last column contains the class label, and is based on a radiologist's opinion or a biopsy. This data was obtained from the KDD Cup 2008 challenge.\n",

Both exhibit almost near perfect accuracy (1.0), though, this is not surprising given the highly imbalanced nature of the data set (68689 - 0 and 409 - 1 for the original data set), just predict the most common response, in this case, 0.\n",

    "#### Q: Explain what these evaluation metrics (true positive rate and the true negative rate) mean for the specific task of cancer detection. \n",

    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while sensitivity and specificity are easy to measure, they're not very useful in clinical practice since a clinician doesn't know if a given patient has the disease in question or not.  This is the reason why the clinician performs the diagnostic test in the first place. Instead, the clinician wants to know, given the test result, how likely is it that the patient has the disease, this is known as the positive predictive value (ppv).\n",

    "A different picture emerges when we compare the confusion matrices, true positive rates, and true negative rates of the two classifiers.  When making comparisons, the fitted logistic regression classifier is clearly the superior model, based on comparing the true positive rates: 27% for the logistic regression classifier vs 0% for the all 0's classifier. Given that we're trying to identify a malignant tumor, a potentially fatal condition, the all 0's classifier will never predict a malignant tumor, making it a totally ineffective model.  \n",

    "The true negative rates for both classifiers are almost equivalent, at or very near to 100%: 99.96% for the fitted logistic regression classifier and 100% for the all 0's classifier.  However, for such a serious condition, we'd rather have a higher true positive rates at the expense of a lower true negative rates.  While there's definitely room for improvement in the logistic regression classifier's true positive rate, anything is better than the all 0's classifier true positive rate of 0%!\n",

The all 0's classifier ROC curve is a straight line with slope = 1 and y-intercept at x = 0.  This is equivalent to a truly random (and therefore very poor) classifier, meaning, it's no better at identifying true positives than flipping a coin.

    "#### Q: Suppose a clinician told you that diagnosing a cancer patient as normal is twice as critical an error as diagnosing a normal patient as having cancer. Based on this information, what threshold would you recommend the clinician to use? What is the TPR and FPR of the classifier at this threshold?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this criteria, we took two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** *Visual approach* - We constructed a figure, see above, that consists of two plots, FNR and FPR both scaled corresponding to meet the clinician's criteria.  We could then visually determine the point at which the two plots intersect, this corresponds to the predicted class probability threshold at which diagnosing a cancer patient as normal is twice as bad as diagnosing a normal patient with cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** *Iterative approach* - We iterate through a range of predicted class probability thresholds between 0 and 1 to determine at which threshold the ratio of the number of False Positives to False Negative is 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the visual and iterative approach produced a predicted class probability threshold of 0.116, and we verified our fitted model yields 50 False Negatives and 100 False Positive when we use this threshold.  The TPR and FPR of the classifier at this threshold is 0.5192 and 0.0059, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q; Compute the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for both the fitted classifier and the all 0's classifier. How does the difference in the AUCs of the two classifiers compare with the difference between their classification accuracies in Question 1, Part 2(A)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for both the fitted classifier and the all 0's classifier is 0.93 and 0.5, respectively, as shown in the ROC plot.  An AUC of 0.5 is the lowest possible AUC and it corresponds to a truly random (and very poor) classifier as implied earlier.  Recall, the classification accuracies for both classifiers in Question 1, Part 2(A) were almost identical at ~99%.  AUC is a a better (more approproiate) quantitative metric to assess and compare binary classifier performance(s).\n",
